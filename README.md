# OCR-NER DocExtract

Welcome to **OCR-NER DocExtract**! This project focuses on developing a customized Named Entity Recognizer (NER) coupled with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to intelligently extract text and data from various types of documents, with a primary emphasis on business cards.

## Project Overview

The project combines Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to achieve its goals:

- **Computer Vision Module**: This module involves scanning documents, locating text, and extracting text from images using tools like OpenCV and Pytesseract.
  
- **Natural Language Processing**: Here, the extracted text undergoes entity extraction, text cleaning, and parsing using libraries such as Spacy and Pandas.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several stages:

### Stage 1: Project Setup
- Install Python and necessary dependencies to get started.

### Stage 2: Data Preparation
- Gather images containing documents (e.g., business cards) and utilize Pytesseract for text extraction.
- Perform necessary cleaning and preprocessing of the extracted text data.

### Stage 3: NER Data Labeling
- Label the extracted data using BIO tagging (B - Beginning, I - Inside, O - Outside) for Named Entity Recognition.

### Stage 4: Data Preprocessing
- Further refine and preprocess the labeled text data to prepare it for model training.

### Stage 5: Train NER Model
- Configure and train a Named Entity Recognition model using Spacy, tailored to recognize entities from the processed text data.

### Stage 6: Predict Entities
- Apply the trained model to predict entities from new documents, establishing a robust data pipeline for entity extraction.

### Final Stage: Create Document Scanner App
- Integrate all components to develop a comprehensive document scanner application capable of extracting text and entities from various document types.
