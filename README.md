# OCR-NER-DocExtract
OCR-NER DocExtract
Welcome to OCR-NER DocExtract! This project focuses on developing a customized Named Entity Recognizer (NER) to extract entities from scanned documents, primarily focusing on business cards.
Project Overview
The project seamlessly integrates Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to achieve its objectives:
•	Computer Vision Module: This component involves scanning documents, detecting text regions, and extracting text from images using tools such as OpenCV and Pytesseract.
•	Natural Language Processing: Here, the extracted text undergoes entity extraction, text cleaning, and parsing using libraries like Spacy and Pandas.
Project Structure
The project is organized into the following stages:
Stage 1: Project Setup
•	Install Python and necessary dependencies to get started.
Stage 2: Data Preparation
•	Gather images containing documents (e.g., business cards) and utilize Pytesseract for text extraction.
•	Perform necessary cleaning and preprocessing of the extracted text data.
Stage 3: NER Data Labeling
•	Label the extracted data using BIO tagging (B - Beginning, I - Inside, O - Outside) for Named Entity Recognition.
Stage 4: Data Preprocessing
•	Further refine and preprocess the labeled text data to prepare it for model training.
Stage 5: Train NER Model
•	Configure and train a Named Entity Recognition model using Spacy, tailored to recognize entities from the processed text data.
Stage 6: Predict Entities
•	Apply the trained model to predict entities from new documents, establishing a robust data pipeline for entity extraction.
Final Stage: Create Document Scanner App
•	Integrate all components to develop a comprehensive document scanner application capable of extracting text and entities from various document types.
